# Titanic_Kaggle
Here you can see my solution to the problem from the popular Kaggle competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster".
On a labeled sample of data about the surviving and dead passengers of the infamous ship, I needed to train a model capable of guessing whether a particular passenger survived.
Follow the link for a description of the datasets used: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data.
In the repository you can find the training and test datasets themselves and a notebook with a solution and a description of my steps.
